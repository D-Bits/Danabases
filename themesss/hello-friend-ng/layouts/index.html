        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Dana Lockwood, and I am a programmer and 
            avid technology enthusiast. While I primarily specialize in implementing a variety 
            of elegant solutions using Python 3 and PostgreSQL, I also have a background in 
            multiple different languages and technologies, such as C#/.NET Core, HTML, CSS, 
            and more.
        </p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>On this site, you will find a collection of my projects, blog posts, and other 
                resources that I have found useful in my journey as a programmer. I hope you 
                find something here that inspires you or helps you in your own programming 
                endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>I also like to cook, and will be posting recipes here in the future.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experiences
