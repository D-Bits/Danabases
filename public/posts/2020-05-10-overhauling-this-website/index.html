In this blog post, I would like to go over how I went about overhauling the website, as well as some of my reasons for doing so.</p><h2 id=why>Why?</h2><p>In the previous iteration, this blog was built on Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub Pages, without a custom domain. While that setup worked out well enough for starting out, I found myself in the market for a different static site generator, and consequently, a new service to host my website. While Jekyll served my needs well enough for the short term, I increasingly found that my lack of Ruby knowledge was making things difficult for me. Furthermore, as this was the only Ruby project I have ever worked on, I didn&rsquo;t really have much incentive to immerse myself in the language. Also, there were certain features that Jekyll required third party packages and extra configuration to implement, such as pagination, which I felt should have been included by default.</p><h2 id=choosing-a-static-site-generator>Choosing a Static Site Generator</h2><p>With this in mind, I set out on finding a new static site generator. The two main alternatives to Jekyll that I looked at were Pelican and Hugo. While Pelican certainly appealed to me, being a Pythonista and all, I ultimately decided to opt for Hugo, due to the fact that did not require any setup or configuration (other than downloading and installing a binary), the extensive selection of quality themes, as well as its incredibly fast, and auto-reloading, development server. In addition to that, even though Hugo is written in Go, it is not a package for the language that requires Go to already be installed. Instead, to install Hugo, one simply either downloads an installer from the Hugo website, or installs it through a package manager. I opted for the later of the two.</p><h2 id=building-the-website>Building the Website</h2><p>With a choice of a new static site generator made, I set out to start redeveloping my website. I will not detail every aspect of re-building the website, since that is far too much territory to cover in a single blog post. Therefore, I will just give a very high-level overview here. Once Hugo is installed, creating a new Hugo website is a simple as using the handy SDK that Hugo comes with by running <code>hugo new site &lt;site_name></code>.</p><p><img src=/assets/pics/hugo-file-structure.jpg alt=file-structure></p><p><em>The project structure generating by Hugo</em></p><p>Ultimately, I do not consider myself a front-end web developer, or any kind of expert on CSS. Therefore, rather than code the entire website from scratch, I made to choose to use one of Hugo&rsquo;s pre-built themes from their <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/gallery/>gallery</a>. Eventually, I settled on a rather nice theme called <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/>Notepadium</a>. To apply this theme, you would first clone the git repo for the theme into your project&rsquo;s <code>theme</code> directory with <code>git submodule add &lt;theme_url></code>. Then, open your <code>config.toml</code> file.</p><p>In the top of that file, you would then modify the <code>theme</code> variable to be equal to <code>hugo-notepadium</code>, and (optionally) set <code>style</code> to &ldquo;dark&rdquo;, if you want a dark version of the theme. At this point, you can start adding Markdown files to the <code>content</code> directory, such an <code>about.md</code>, or some blog posts to a directory called <code>blog</code>, <code>posts</code>, or something to that effect.</p><h2 id=hosting>Hosting</h2><p>Since GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, which I am no longer using, I found myself in need of a new hosting service. For static websites, I found the most ideal option to be Netlify. Netlify not only allows you to host static sites for free, but also allows you to easily add a lot of functionality to them, that would normally be associated with web applications that have server-side code. Netlify also makes it very easy to automate deployments by connecting a git repository to your Netlify project, so that any commits that are pushed to a specific branch of your remote repository are automatically deployed to Netlify.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Currently, I am quite satisfied with the new setup. Although I still have a lot to learn about Hugo, and everything I can do with it, I found it pretty easy to get started with. Furthermore, while the theme I chose was pretty nice as well, I should note that even though I used a pre-built theme for this site, I did add at least of some of my own, custom styles to it. I am also highly satisfied with Netlify thus far, as it really does enable one to push the boundaries of what can be accomplished with a simple, static website.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
