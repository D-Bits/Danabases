      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started exploring how to store JSON data in a traditional relational&#xA;database management system (RDBMS), rather than a dedicated form of JSON/document&#xA;storage, like MongoDB. While I could write a lot more about the problems with&#xA;MongoDB, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I want to do here. Instead, I want to&#xA;focus primarily on how to store and query JSON in PostgreSQL. However, I&#xA;should note that PostgreSQL is not the only RDBMS that supports JSON storage.&#xA;I know that MariaDB also does, as of v10.2, and possibly other RDBMS as well. However,&#xA;since I have been mostly using and enjoying Postgres for awhile now,&#xA;I decided to focus on that, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
