Mind you, I am not a physicist, nor do I have an extensive mathematical background, so I certainly was not using Python to do anything that was terribly complicated. Instead, I was using it to do more simple, but still productive (not to mention fun) calculations. So, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
