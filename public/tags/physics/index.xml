      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading about how my favorite programing language (Python) was used to develop the first ever image of a black hole, I felt inspired to use the language to do some gravitational physics of my own. Mind you, I am not a physicist, nor do I have an extensive mathematical background, so I certainly was not using Python to do anything that was terribly complicated. Instead, I was using it to do more simple, but still productive (not to mention fun) calculations. So, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
