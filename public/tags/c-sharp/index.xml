successfully invoke external commands in C# programs, which I hope will make
me a considerably more productive C# programmer. So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s
dive into the nitty gritty details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="purpose"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you might ask: why would one need to do this? Ultimately, the potential
to automate all sorts of things by invoking external commands inside a program
are nearly limitless. I have already been relying heavily on &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run()&lt;/code&gt;
in Python&amp;rsquo;s standard library to do exactly that for a while now. Yet, as much
as I have been utilizing that, I recently started to explore if I could implement
the same, or at least similar, functionality in other languages. C# has long been
my designated language to fall back on, when Python isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for the task
at hand, such as when I need to easily cross-compile binaries. Therefore, I
started looking for whatever documentation and guides I could find on the
topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
